# Enable SMS

In order to send or receive text messages via the node-tcrouter package, all desired contacts must be added to the TC Router's "Phonebook."

The Phonebook is found in "I/O" -&gt; "Phonebook."  After adding in your list of contacts, click the apply button.  These contacts can now be reached by the node-tcrouter package.
