# Socket Server

After logging in, the socket server feature must be enabled in order to communicate and control the device.  In the navigation tree, select "Device services" -&gt; "Socket server" -&gt; "Configuration"

From this configuration window, enable the socket server.  It is recommended to leave the rest of the settings as their default setting.  At the time of the writing of this document, only 'LF' is supported as a newline character by the node-tcrouter package.
